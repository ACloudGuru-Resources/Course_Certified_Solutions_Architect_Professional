Triggering a Lambda Function in Response to a CloudTrail Log Event
Introduction
In this lab, we are going to go over the process for triggering a Lambda function in response to a CloudTrail event. We will be using a variety of services, including SNS, CloudTrail, S3, Lambda, and SES to accomplish our goal of being notified via email when changes are made within the console. This is important for tracking changes that are made within your AWS account.

Solution
You can copy and paste the code for the Lambda function from this lab's GitHub repository. Be sure to replace the placeholder email addresses in the ToAddresses and Source lines with the actual email addresses you will be using.
